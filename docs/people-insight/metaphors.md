# Metaphors of MLTC lived experience

![Metaphors](../assets/S2-metaphors.jpg)
/// caption
Metaphor activity - Liverpool Stage 2 workshop.
///

## Overview 
A set of metaphor images brought up by people living with multiple long-term conditions as they reflected on their daily life experiences and navigating health & care systems. The images are generated using AI and validated through a workshop. They serve as visual tools to prompt discussion and convey MLTC experiences in a relatable and accessible way.

## Application & use 
In Stage 1, metaphors emerged from activity books, interviews, and focus groups with people with MLTC. Metaphors that were said were translated into AI-generated images and validated through a workshop which our public advisors helped to facilitate. During the workshop, participants refined existing images, generated new ones, and discussed the use of AI to represent their experiences. 
<br><br>The resulting images were later used in our Stage 2 workshop with health, care, and VCFSE stakeholders as an icebreaker and to prompt discussion on their views of MLTC health and care systems

## Results & insights
People with lived experience thought that the images helped to represent their experiences and highlighting: the burdens of daily life with MLTC; difficulties navigating a complex and unclear system; the emotional and mental toll of MLTC and the critical need for support. Participants in the workshop appreciated having a set of images, because different images resonated on different days, reflecting the shifting nature of living with MLTC. 
<br><br>The images also sparked meaningful discussions among health system stakeholders, who used them to articulate their understanding of MLTC systems and build empathy for those affected.
