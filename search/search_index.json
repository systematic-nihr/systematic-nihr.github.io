Until recently, developing application-specific LLMs required either domain adapatation and transfer learning to revise pre-trained LLMs, or, to adopt cloud-based \"as a service\" LLMs like Claude or ChatGPT and use prompt engineering methods to develop the desired functionality.  To develop the functionality required from driver projects P4 and P5 (as well as the NLU interfaces for applications patient-facing technology in P1) the former is prohibitively expensive and impractical.  The latter approach (prompt engineering) was difficult to justify because \"as a service\" LLMs could not guarantee the security and privacy of confidential medical information being transmitted and processed outside of secure data environments required by the NHS.  However, with the advent of quantised LLMs such as gemma3 derived from industry-leading foundation models for question answering, summarisation, and 'reasoning', it is possible to develop prompt-based functionality locally (i.e. privately, on a local installation of ollama) on a single GPU with performance approaching that of the ''full precision'' model.  These recent advances in LLM technology enable our LLM-based work -- critical for the implementation of P4 and P5 -- to re-use existing (but quantised) foundation models, averting the needs for unrealistically large amounts of data or excessive compute resources.

The Patient Public Involvement and Engagement- PPIE group consists of seven members of the public, representing a range of diversity and intersectionality, all members having lived experience of Multiple Long-Term Conditions-MLTC\u2019s. Our role has been (and is) to support the development of SysteMatic with our expertise to define and refine the content which we have all witnessed has changed and evolved over time in response to our input. The PPIE group and I have considered how integral we are to the work and to the process and this is evidenced from our regular meetings,  in witnessing the material changes and adaptations  that result with detailed feedback from the team plus the support we are given with adjustments made if required to contribute and the opportunities we have to showcase our involvement\u2013 including writing this blog!! It is so important to reflect on the value of our involvement as part of the process partly to ensure that projects and research really reflect and are grounded and influenced by PPIE input, perspective and knowledge but also to evaluate how we are valued as members of the team and certainly SysteMatic in my experience is an exemplar of PPIE best practice.  </p> <p>In the development stages of SysteMatic, the PPIE group were selected after providing expressions of interest on our lived experience of multiple long-term conditions or holding a MLTC carer identity. The expressions of interest also expressed our passion in using our lived experience to effect system change for a better future, and our broad knowledge of how the system impacts us as service users with MLTC\u2019s. This level of insight has made SysteMatic stronger in development being shaped by our understanding of the system to innovate around and highlight what the pinch-points are that make living with MLTCs so difficult to manage and navigate. I have seen how my voice and the contributions of the group have altered SysteMatic from the get-go. We have contributed to ethics approval, the pilot work particularly the various iterations of the person map, ongoing discussion at each phase discussing what worked or didn\u2019t or could be reframed. Designing the system maps and getting creative with post-it notes to highlight the areas of strength and discuss areas which overlapped or needed further consideration. Whether in workshops or sandpit events with stakeholders we have been able to share our views in coproduction alongside healthcare professionals and academics/researchers to explain and help to steer the direction SysteMatic has taken to be the best version of itself.  </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>PPIE involvement in the SysteMatic activity book design and development process. </p> <p></p> <p>I asked the PPIE group to share their thoughts on how they view their impact and involvement in SysteMatic and to consider interactions they have had where they have observed shifts and changes:  </p> <p>Hilary Garrett, PPIE Lead SysteMatic</p> <p>From the exciting early stages of the first bid submission I felt I had a genuine impact on shaping the proposal. I feel my voice was valued from the outset and has continued to be heard at every stage of the process      to date. It has been great to help to pull together and be part of this enthusiastic and talented team of public contributors. Together they represent a great many years' worth of lived experience. In addition, I have     benefited enormously in participating in Systematic not least because of my greater clarity about where the study fits in moving forward the agenda of equity in health across the healthcare research landscape for          those of us with MLTCs.</p> <p></p> <p>PPIE lead, Hilary, speaking at the Liverpool sandpit event.</p> <p></p> <p>Patricia Jamal, PPIE SysteMatic</p> <p>This project came to me at the right time\u2026 I have had a number of experiences as a public contributor and as one who is living with Multiple Long-Term Conditions, so I felt ready to contribute with quality and             effectiveness. I thoroughly enjoyed working with such a diverse and knowledgeable set of individuals, each bringing their unique contribution, and learning from each other through the process. Throughout the diverse       discussions we\u2019ve had over the last few months, I felt valued, listened to and my thoughts taken into consideration. It is obvious that PPIE is taken very seriously and indeed very much looked for as a means to            enhance the research process</p> <p></p> <p>Terry Bryant, PPIE SysteMatic</p> <p>The Systematic project is intriguing in many ways. Not only is it a fresh and insightful approach to qualifying and quantifying the healthcare landscape for people with multiple long-term conditions, but from the     outset the project has meaningfully and substantively engaged with public contributors. Well-managed meetings where the 'public voice' is valued and listened to creates a genuinely collaborative and positive               environment. For me, what Systematic also, and most importantly, offers is the real prospect of improving healthcare provision by aiding both healthcare professionals and patients. </p> <p></p> <p>It is powerful and empowering for me to read these reflections as they illustrate so clearly why projects and research must embed lived experience to generate meaningful change. My own example to share is an email I sent and the subsequent feedback I received from the Systematic team which resulted in an identifiable change to SysteMatic. I had been reflecting specifically on system pinch-points which I felt needed addressing within the person and system map with more emphasis: \u201cThere is a person cost re time/access for MLTC, potential barriers re bad days, loss of appointments/place on waiting lists and having to be re-referred with more time on waiting lists which can all adversely impact health, hope and quality of life. Equally there are system costs with missed appointments/more investment re worsening health over waiting times which innovation could support with online consultations/appointments (I know there are tech barriers and digital poverty). Tests conducted at local hubs have ecological benefits to the carbon footprint for all, so through reducing the impact of patient commutes to distant services when local community appointments could achieve better patient experience is necessary. Many of my consultant appointments do not require F2F so could be triaged with that in mind with bloods/weight managed prior to appointments in local settings to have results in real time for virtual consultations. Another factor is distress around long clinic waiting times which in my case lead to increased anxiety, depression and concern growing exponentially with long waits post consultation for more or repeat tests to be set up and the results shared. More local and online options would allow additional benefits with space freed up in the system to speed up access to those on referral for first appointments to be triaged on fast track.\u201d  </p> <p>The response to my feedback and reflection from the team was really positive and generated a change which is now present in the current iteration of SysteMatic, and I was told, \u201cI think it\u2019s an important point re location of treatment and barriers around travel and transport. It came up in the journey maps and system maps\u201d As a result an extra dimension called \u2018transportation &amp; geographical location\u2019 was added to the person map and is linked to \u2018system navigation\u2019 on the last page.  Further to this and validating my contribution and knowledge I was informed, \u201cHappy to hear your thoughts and suggestions on incorporating into the person map for evolving and updating the materials. Your point is really relevant to some of the ongoing discussions around work packages and projects. I will add some notes from what you\u2019ve said to the relevant documents so that people working on those work packages and projects can see them.\u201d I think this example illustrates the dynamic at work in Systematic where the research/development team and PPIE are not separate entities but are integrated as working colleagues in the development of SysteMatic.  </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Left: person map. Right: 'system navigation' section of the person map, including the updated 'location and transportation' dimension.</p> <p>I hope this blog has allowed you to understand more about PPIE in SysteMatic and the benefits of PPIE in projects and research (if this is new to you). Also, how reflecting on involvement can reveal overtly the interactions where our PPIE insight and knowledge has impacted directly on the work or adaptations which have increased the utility and benefit of the output. Alongside this also important to consider is how has PPIE involvement been viewed and embedded by the team to be successfully integrated or conversely not!!? Within SysteMatic I am happy to share the PPIE group are considered as lived experience researchers working in coproduction as valued team members but sadly within research this is not always the case and best practice is not demonstrated. If reading this blog has given you pause for thought as a researcher to think about PPIE and how you engage this aspect within your projects or if you are a PPIE member I invite you to please reflect on that involvement to shape and influence research grounded with that lens.  </p>","tags":["Blog"]},{"location":"people-insight/robert-dan-story/","title":"Robert &amp; Dan's Story","text":""},{"location":"people-insight/robert-dan-story/#robert-dans-story","title":"Robert &amp; Dan's Story","text":"<p>Robert 42, has faced a lifetime of adversity, including care experience, addiction, and institutionalisation in hospitals and prisons.

Systemic methods, on the other hand, are especially helpful when many different stakeholders interact in a dynamic complex setting, where there is no initial consensus on the problem definition, the expected future, or a shared vision of what to reach.\". Hieronymi (2013)</p> <p>3rd-order approaches are therefore characterised by drawing widely from eclectic theoretical orientations of \"systems theory\" as defined and discussed in the diverse literature spanning biology, physics and mathematics through to social sciences.  </p> <p>Defining the qualitative boundaries between 1st- and 2nd-order approaches is difficult because 3rd-order approaches often use or borrow theory (e.g. concepts such as feedback and regulation, adapatation or learning, system instability and complex dynamics) and sometimes methods (e.g. mathematical and computational techniques) common to all three orders.  However, 3rd-order approaches often use the concepts from 1st and 2nd-order approaches qualitatively rather than quantitatively or literally; for example, while a 3rd-order model might articulate the existence of negative feedback between two or more system components, we are unlikely to be able to produce a useful quantitative model that describes and makes quantitative predictions about the feedback processes using differential equations or state-space models.  This mirrors what Checkland (2000) calls the \"hard\" and \"soft\" systems distinction (see also, Costa, 2019) where 1st and 2nd order approaches would be considered the former, and the methods used in SysteMatic's design process are \"soft\".  </p> <p>Approaches we have called 3rd-order are those that don't seek to optimise (1st order) or necessarily innovate (2nd order, systems engineering) on an existing model of a system (for example, improving patient throughput given a set of existing services and constraints to be satisfied) but rather, may help transition from an existing model of healthcare to something very different and re-imagined.  This open-endedness implies that some of the resulting models or tentative proposals for a healthcare system are incompatible with how healthcare is currently understood or delivered; i.e. they may be unrealistic given the immediate and medium-term funding for acute and secondary care in hospitals.  Indeed, Checkland's Soft Systems Methodology (reviewed in Checkland, 2000) emphasises that any formal model of a system is epistemological rather than ontological -- this means it is one perceived model of a system (components, relationships and abstractions) and there may be many candidate models that each depend on the author/stakeholder articulating them.  </p> <p>Hieronymi (2013) then provides an overview of systems principles, theories and their philosophical connections and outlines \"systems approaches\" that help ground these principles in practice -- notably, in the familiar iterative four-stage process of \"Design, Plan, Intervene, Analyse\" -- for comparison, see our MLTC-focused design process and the \"double diamond\" design process.</p> <p>The overarching tenets of 3rd-order approaches are:</p> <ul> <li>Inter- and transdisciplinary expertise</li> <li>Theories of systems drawing from formal sciences, biology, social- and cognitive sciences</li> <li>Taking a systems approach, inheriting from the above</li> <li>A system is inherently open (rather than closed) with porous boundaries</li> <li>The system exhibits non-linear or unpredictable behaviours (that are difficult to model using methods common to 1st- and 2nd-order approaches) and are context-dependent (Preiser 2019)</li> <li>Systems are epistemological (rather than ontological) entities (Reynolds et al. 2016) consistent with soft-systems methodology (Checkland 2000). 3rd-Order approaches view any \u2018system\u2019 as one possible model of components and their relationships/dependencies that inextricably depend on the perspective of the agent articulating that model.</li> <li>A system model will therefore vary with the level of abstraction adopted, the individual modeller and the appropriate methodologies and tools will vary accordingly.</li> </ul>","tags":["Stage 1","Systems Science","Systems engineering","Soft systems models","Socio-technical systems"]},{"location":"systems-science/transition/#methods-and-approach","title":"Methods and Approach","text":"<p>Consequently, a 3rd-order approach naturally invites methodology/frameworks such as participatory design, patient-public co-design, soft-systems methdology (SSM) (Augustsson, Churruca, and Braithwaite 2019) and action research (Checkland 2012; Koshy, Koshy, and Waterman 2010; Meyer 2000) but importantly, does not exclude formal methods (Schwaninger and Gr\u00f6sser 2008) e.g. agent-based modelling and system dynamics (Liu et al. 2018).
